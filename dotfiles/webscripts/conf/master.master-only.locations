# master-only is for locations that have no master version. The reason they're here
# is so you can disable them if you can't connect to master (vpn down or something)

# I don't know where cms is served from...
location /cms {
    proxy_set_header Accept-Encoding ""; # to uncompress responses so subs_filter works
    proxy_pass http://master.eng.blurb.com;
